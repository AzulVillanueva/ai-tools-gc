                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a key ally in today's workplace. From automating repetitive tasks to enhancing creativity and boosting productivity, its responsible and strategic use can deliver significant competitive advantages.</p>
                
                <p>However, its widespread adoption also brings new challenges: improper use of sensitive information, overreliance, inaccurate results, or unnecessary licensing costs. That's why having a clear guide is essential to help teams integrate these tools effectively, ethically, and securely.</p>
                
                <p>This guide outlines a set of <span class="highlight">general best practices applicable</span> to any professional setting, followed by category-specific recommendations. The goal is to maximize the value of AI in daily work, while minimizing risks and fostering a culture of responsible innovation.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="general-recommendations" class="section">
                <h1>General Recommendations for Professional Use of AI</h1>
                <p>To ensure AI tools are truly effective in the workplace, they must be used strategically and responsibly. By following these best practices, teams can optimize AI performance, safeguard information, and avoid pitfalls like overdependence or unnecessary expenses. Below are the key guidelines for proper use.</p>

                <h2>1. Choose and Use the Right Tool</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use specialized tools based on the task (e.g., GitHub Copilot for development, ChatGPT for writing, Midjourney for visual design).</li>
                    <li>Assess the maturity and reliability of the tool for the problem you're solving.</li>
                    <li>Leverage integrations with existing platforms like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace.</li>
                    <li>Create reusable templates for frequent tasks such as emails, reports, or summaries.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Validate Outputs and Apply Human Judgment</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Treat AI-generated results as drafts—not absolute truths.</li>
                    <li>Pay special attention when reviewing technical, legal, financial, or data analysis content.</li>
                    <li>Combine AI input with professional judgment when making decisions or sharing outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Use AI as a co-pilot, not a replacement for your skills.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Protect Information and Comply with Regulations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not input sensitive, confidential, or proprietary information into non-corporate tools.</li>
                    <li>Ensure tools comply with standards like GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001, or HIPAA.</li>
                    <li>Use enterprise-grade versions with security controls and administrative management.</li>
                    <li>Avoid linking personal accounts to work-related AI tools.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Cybersecurity</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).</li>
                    <li>Use secure password managers like Bitwarden.</li>
                    <li>Monitor access and activity using SIEM tools.</li>
                    <li>Train the team to recognize phishing, fraud, and impersonation attempts.</li>
                    <li>Conduct cybersecurity audits in collaboration with IT teams.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Efficient License and Cost Management</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Centralize license management under corporate accounts.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate whether free versions meet your team's needs.</li>
                    <li>Opt for scalable team plans instead of individual licenses.</li>
                    <li>Audit usage quarterly to remove unused licenses.</li>
                    <li>Group tools by function to avoid redundancy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Integration into the Work Environment</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Embed AI into everyday workflows based on roles and tasks.</li>
                    <li>Connect tools using platforms like Zapier or Make.com.</li>
                    <li>Define usage standards by team or function.</li>
                    <li>Train teams using real business use cases.</li>

                        <li><strong>Give clear and specific instructions</strong>: the more detailed and precise your input, the better the AI's response will be. If you're asking about a technical topic, include key terms and specify the structure you expect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Encourage reasoning and detailed answers</strong>: when asking for explanations or solutions, request that the AI explain its reasoning or outline the steps it followed. This leads to more complete answers and helps identify logical gaps.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust tone and style for your audience</strong>: if you're using conversational AI for customer service or internal communication, tailor the tone of the responses to fit the audience's expectations—whether formal, friendly, technical, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leverage its summarization capabilities</strong>: use virtual assistants to distill large volumes of information into clear, concise summaries that highlight key points.</li>
                        <li><strong>Review responses before sharing</strong>: always double-check AI-generated responses before sharing them with others—especially in formal or sensitive contexts. While AI can offer relevant insights, it's crucial to validate and refine the output when needed.</li>

                    <h3>Best Practices to Avoid Risks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Don't assume the AI fully understands context</strong>: despite their capabilities, virtual assistants may miss nuances or specific details. Provide comprehensive information and clarify as needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid delegating critical decisions without oversight</strong>: these tools are great for brainstorming and suggestions, but important decisions—such as business strategy or legal matters—should always be reviewed by a human.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't rely entirely on AI for complex tasks</strong>: tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Claude are powerful, but they're not infallible. Users must stay actively involved to ensure outputs are correct and actionable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect privacy and sensitive data</strong>: when interacting with AI assistants, avoid sharing confidential, personal, or sensitive information. Always review the platform's privacy policies and terms of use to understand how data is handled.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manage ambiguous or off-target answers</strong>: if the AI gives incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate responses, refine your prompt or provide additional context. Rephrasing often improves the quality of interaction.</li>
